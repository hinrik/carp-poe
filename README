NAME
    Carp::POE - Carp adapted to POE

SYNOPSIS
     use Carp::POE;
     use POE;
 
     POE::Session->create(
         package_states => [
             main => [qw( _start test_event )]
         ],
     );

     $poe_kernel->run();

     sub _start {
         $_[KERNEL]->yield(test_event => 'fail');
     }
 
     sub test_event {
         my $arg = $_[ARG0];
         if ($arg ne 'correct') {
             carp "Argument is incorrect!";
         }
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides the same functions as Carp, but modifies the
    behavior of "carp()" and "croak()" if called inside a POE event handler.
    The file names/line numbers in the emitted warnings are replaced with
    POE::Session's $_[CALLER_FILE] and $_[CALLER_LINE]. This is useful as it
    will direct you to the code that posted the event instead of directing
    you to some subroutine in POE::Session which actually called the event
    handler.

    Calls to "carp()" and "croak()" in subroutines that are not POE event
    handlers will not be effected, so it's always safe to "use Carp::POE"
    instead of "Carp".

TODO
    Do something clever with "cluck()" and "confess()".
